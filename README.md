# Netflix-Clone - HTML & CSS

I built this project as a part of the Sigma Web Development Course by CodeWithHarry. This is a simple clone of the Netflix homepage, created using only HTML and CSS, where I honed my front-end skills and improved my understanding of responsive web design.

<b>Features:</b>
<li> Responsive layout mimicking Netflix's homepage </li>
<li>Clean, modern UI design </li>
<li>Fully functional navigation bar </li>
